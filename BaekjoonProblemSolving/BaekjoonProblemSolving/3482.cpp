&Title
3482ë²ˆ - Labyrinth

&Question
The northern part of the Pyramid contains a 
very large and complicated labyrinth. The labyrinth is divided 
into square blocks, each of them either filled by 
rock, or free. There is also a little hook 
on the floor in the center of every free 
block. The ACM have found that two of the 
hooks must be connected by a rope that runs 
through the hooks in every block on the path 
between the connected ones. When the rope is fastened, 
a secret door opens. The problem is that we 
do not know which hooks to connect. That means 
also that the neccessary length of the rope is 
unknown. Your task is to determine the maximum length 
of the rope we could need for a given 
labyrinth. 

&Input
The input consists of T test cases. The 
number of them (T) is given on the first 
line of the input file. Each test case begins 
with a line containing two integers C and R 
(3 <= C,R <= 1000) indicating the number of 
columns and rows. Then exactly R lines follow, each 
containing C characters. These characters specify the labyrinth. Each 
of them is either a hash mark (#) or 
a period (.). Hash marks represent rocks, periods are 
free blocks. It is possible to walk between neighbouring 
blocks only, where neighbouring blocks are blocks sharing a 
common side. We cannot walk diagonally and we cannot 
step out of the labyrinth.The labyrinth is designed in 
such a way that there is exactly one path 
between any two free blocks. Consequently, if we find 
the proper hooks to connect, it is easy to 
find the right path connecting them. 

&Output
Your program must print exactly one line of 
output for each test case. The line must contain 
the sentence "Maximum rope length is X." where X 
is the length of the longest path between any 
two free blocks, measured in blocks. 

&Example

-output
Maximum rope length is 0.
Maximum rope length is 8.
