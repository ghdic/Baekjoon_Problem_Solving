&Title
4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

&Question
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of siz
e m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The over
all run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empt
y.
Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
